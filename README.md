This is a simple project build using python without any complex libraries and animation.
Before starting the coding, first understand the algorithm clearly. I clearly explained the full workflow of the code from the starting.
Each line of the code is explained in algorithm, just a basic knowledge in python is enough to complete this project.
I explained the usage of some libraries also clearly in algorithm.

To run the application:
-----------------------
Don't run in python idle, it is also explained in algorithm.
run it in windows/linux os terminal.
->Go to the folder directory using cd path/folder_name
->Type "snake_game_project.py" to start the game.
